# Capture the Ball

## Description
This is my very first game project. For this project, I took inspiration from the common arcade game called Breakout, which has the main feature of making the block disappear upon colliding with the ball. In this project, I created my own sprite player which resembles an evil mushroom. The user is able to move the player in any direction and has window collision to restrict the player movement boundary. The goal of the game is to 'capture' the ball by colliding with the balls. However, the game constantly spawns new balls, making an infinite loop or a never ending game. In addition, the game has a point system which keeps track the number of times the user captures the balls.
