# Capture the Ball

## Description
In this project, I decided to code my own clock and timer countdown. This app includes a clock and a timer countdown, which are the two main features, a date, and increments, decrements, start, stop, and reset buttons to control the timer countdown. This app also includes some basic CSS styling such as colors and font sizes.
